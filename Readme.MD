The Telefonica Seguros BI Intelligence project transformed fragmented administrative data into a strategic executive dashboard to optimize client retention and financial stability. By developing specialized KPIs—such as the "Settled Claims with Indemnization" metric—and utilizing systematic data imputation, I identified high-value segments and churn risks. The final solution provides a "single source of truth" that aligns financial reserves with actual monthly payouts, offering a clear roadmap for service optimization.
I engineered a robust data pipeline using Power BI and Power Query, performing extensive cleaning and statistical imputation to ensure forecast reliability. The analysis leveraged DAX for complex settlement and reserve-to-payment measures. By conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and time-series modeling, I provided a granular view of portfolio risk and seasonal claim spikes, ensuring all strategic initiatives are backed by validated, high-quality data.

The Python Minesweeper project is an interactive GUI-based application that translates classic logic-puzzle mechanics into a functional desktop game. The primary objective was to manage real-time user interactions and hidden game states across a dynamic grid. By implementing automated mine generation and a recursive-style neighbor-check algorithm, the project successfully handles complex win/loss conditions, providing a seamless and engaging user experience.
The technical architecture utilizes a modular, multi-file Python structure, leveraging Tkinter for the graphical interface and Canvas for grid rendering. I developed a custom event-handling system to manage mouse clicks, using coordinate mapping to link visual squares to an underlying logic array. The game features an automated randomized mine generator and an adjacency logic engine that calculates nearby threats in real-time. By integrating a dedicated imageTools library and handling multi-window transitions (Start, Win, and Game Over screens), I ensured a professional UI flow backed by rigorous input validation and state management.

The Determinants of March Madness Success project investigates the long-standing debate of whether offensive or defensive efficiency is a more reliable predictor of postseason achievement. By analyzing a decade of NCAA Division I basketball data, the project aimed to move beyond anecdotal coaching cliches and provide a quantifiable basis for tournament success. The primary objective was to identify which performance metrics most closely correlate with deep tournament runs, offering stakeholders and analysts a data-driven framework for evaluating team potential in high-stakes, single-elimination environments.
Executed in R (RMarkdown), the technical workflow involved advanced data wrangling with dplyr and the engineering of a "Postseason Score" (PST) to weight tournament progress from the Round of 68 to the National Championship. The methodology focused on standardizing "Four Factor" statistics through Z-score normalization, allowing for objective comparisons across different team styles and eras. Using linear regression modeling and conference segmentation, the analysis successfully demonstrated a causal link between defensive performance—specifically Effective Field Goal Percentage Allowed—and championship-level success, proving that defensive consistency is a superior predictor of longevity in the tournament compared to offensive metrics alone.
